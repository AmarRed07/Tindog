 CONTAINER:

start out at the top, and set elements inside of it and it automatically
jumpst around as the pages get bigger or small to keepm the elements inside of the 
container.

For example:

<div class= "container" style="background-color: red;">
    <div>
        <h1> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to 
        make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also 
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It 
        was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
        'like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</h1>
    </div>
</div>

Ther would be a red container that keeps the elements inside of it. So kind of like
the header I had for the internship assignment

CONTAINER-FLUID:

This takes up 100% width of the screen.

So for example.

<div class="container-fluid" style="background-color: blue;">
    <div>
        <h1> Everything inside of here would take up 100% of the width of the 
        screen. The blue bacground container would also take up 100%</h1>
    </div>
</div>
